I know I know, I'm not publishing so much on here, so is this meta and
cliché article even necessary when there's no new content anyway?

I think so.

I want to clarify some things, I want it to be very clear.

As an artist, as a dev and as a human I'm strongly against gen AI for many reasons.
This little article is here to cite a few of them,
but mostly to say that no gen AI will be used here.

## I did use gen AI

Mostly for code, a bit for proofreading (even for here), and a little bit for advice.

It was okay, I mean it sometimes worked fine.

## I won't use gen AI anymore

### Fun

It killed ALL the fun I had coding.
I started coding to have fun, working for people killed that a little.
Gen AI completely killed any remains of fun.
Even the side projects became boring.

I always knew that in coding, the process is what I enjoy.
Not the result. Gen AI abstracts the process in favor of results.

### Ethics

Above the fun, gen AI comes with many ethics concerns that CAN'T be ignored.

This is a quick article, but mostly the issues I currently have are:

- the terrible ecological cost for something so futile
- the fact that it's used to replace the creative stuff instead of the boring stuff
- the fact that no one understands the implications of AI nor it's limits
- the training based on stealing
- the enshitification of every single product that includes AI
- the core usage encourages stealing by providing generations based on someone else's work, often copying it with added errors
- the misinformation and confidence that it serves
- the fact that it poisons the rest of the web
- Gen AI is a tool CURRENTLY being used by the far right to create and spread racist narratives

All of this is on the top of my head, and of course there's many more arguments.
