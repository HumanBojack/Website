I know I know, I'm not publishing so much on here, so is this meta and
clich√© article even necessary when there's no new content anyway?

I think so.

I want to clarify some things, I want it to be very clear.

As an artist, as a dev and as a human I'm strongly against gen AI for many reasons.
This little article is here to cite a few of them,
but mostly to say that no gen AI will be used here.

## I did use gen AI

Mostly for code, a bit for proofreading (even for here), and a little bit for advice.

It was okay, I mean it sometimes worked fine.

## I won't use gen AI anymore

### Fun

It killed ALL the fun I had coding.
I started coding to have fun, working for people killed that a little.
Gen AI completely killed any remains of fun.
Even the side projects became boring.

I always knew that in coding, the process is what I enjoy.
Not the result. Gen AI abstracts the process in favor of results.

### Ethics

Above the fun, gen AI comes with many ethics concerns that CAN'T be ignored.

This is a quick article, but mostly the issues I currently have are:

- the terrible ecological cost for something so futile
- the fact that it's used to replace the creative stuff instead of the boring stuff
- the fact that no one understands the implications of AI nor it's limits
- the training based on stealing
- the enshitification of every single product that includes AI
- the core usage encourages stealing by providing generations based on someone else's work, often copying it with added errors
- the misinformation and confidence that it serves
- the fact that it poisons the rest of the web

All of this is on the top of my head, and of course there's many more arguments.
