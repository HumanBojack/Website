This project is still under devlopment, as for this readme.

This website is being built using **svelte** and **sveltekit**. I will be hosting it on either vercel or netlify (but probably vercel).

Come back later for more informations! Also, not everything has been commited nor pushed, so I don't think you can run it yet (but why would you?).
